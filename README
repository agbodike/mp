Multiply prime numbers

extends the integer class to determine if a number is prime, find the next prime number after a given integer

execution:

ruby multiply_primes.rb [INTEGER]
if no integer is entered, it defaults to 10

Caveats:
Prime number test method is not a particularly fast approach, but for small numbers this is it appears to be faster, for an application that needed to identify large quantities of large primes, it would be necessary to improve the algorhytm.
The command line interface is quite simple. Normally I would use optparse for a more robust command line interface. Additionally I would add an option to select the prime to start with.
No exception handling
